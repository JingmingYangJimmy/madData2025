While Cody goes to find them a place to live and a job for herself, Billy spends all the money they have, most of which came from their friends back home who pitched in to help them build a tiny starting capital, to buy a modestly lucrative plot of land owned by old and bitter Clifton Lundegren. The deal is made after some tough negotiating, but then notorious local oil baron Hap Briggs offers Billy a small piece of his action for the land. Naive Billy goes for it and learns first hand why most people, and especially Clifton, hate the old savvy swindler Hap. Although desperate, Billy decides to do his best to somehow get into the business despite Briggs' paw over the local oil market. Meanwhile, Hap has to deal with his troubled family. His new wife Darla is an elegant but melancholic trophy wife, who knows her place.

Wick's biggest problem is the experienced local Sheriff Tip Harrison, who knows all the skeletons in the townspeople's closets, and suspects Wick and Garry of wrongdoing but can't prove anything yet.

But it was also the age of Machiavelli, of rampant lawlessness, incessant war, and unspeakable depravity. At the heart of the world order was the Vatican, the arbiter of conflicts between kingdoms and empires. And at the center of the Vatican was a man whose quest for power would propel him to seek the ultimate prize: the Holy See of Rome. He was a man whose name would become synonymous with ruthlessness, and whose reign as Pope would be remembered as the most infamous chapter of the history of the Catholic church: Rodrigo Borgia. His four children--Juan, the oldest, a prideful, lazy, unscrupulous sexual predator; Cesare, a young man torn between a faith that was not his calling and his dark violent nature; Lucretia, a young girl discovering the secret power that a woman's sexuality holds; and Goffredo, an innocent child who would come of age in a family riven by conflict--would provide Rodrigo with a challenge as great as the political maneuvering of his political and religious rivals. This show was a one-hour dramatic series that chronicled the rise to power of this Spanish Cardinal and his clan, who sought to establish a dynasty that held sway over the entire world. Though a man of faith, Rodrigo was also in thrall to the pleasures of the flesh. Not only did he deal with the plotting and conspiracies of his fellow cardinals and the representatives of the great powers, but he was locked in a struggle to contain the bitter sibling rivalries that threatened to tear his family apart. This show was a cauldron of intrigue, violence, murder, lust, politics, faith, incest, betrayal, and redemption--a story as compelling and enlightening as the age in which it took place.", "Language": "English", "Country": "France, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic", "Awards": "2 wins & 8 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJjMDI3ZWEtNDQxZS00MzFkLTk5MzItZGE0M2UyZTdkM2I2XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.7", "imdbVotes": "7,411", "imdbID": "tt1736341", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "3", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": -0.3092478811740875, "Tense-Calm": -0.8066795952618122}, "Response": "True"},

Each episode saw a compilation of incidents, ranging from the humorous (e.g., a stranded motorist) to criminal investigations (such as hijackings) and tragic incidents (such as a fiery multi-car pile-up with multiple deaths. Other aspects of Ponch and Jon's daily work were highlighted as well; the social lives of both officers (they were both single) often provided the lighter moments. On occassion, Ponch and Jon were assisted by a female \"Chippie\" at first, the very beautiful Sindy Cahill; and later, the more wholesome Bonnie Clark. In 1982, Ponch got a new partner, Bobby Nelson (series star Wilcox left the show that year), while Nelson's younger brother, Bruce, was a trainee on the force. By now, the female \"Chippie\" was the attractive Kathy Lindahan.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "2 wins & 4 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWM3MWM0YTctNGZkNi00ZjRlLWIwNzctMjVmZGEwMGYxYjAzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.4", "imdbVotes": "12,080", "imdbID": "tt0075488", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "6", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": -0.15686942636966705, "Tense-Calm": -0.6336475496646017}, "Response": "True"},

Chance's natural talent for psychoanalysis allows him to easily assess everyone that wants his help but that doesn't mean he can actually cure them or even help them.

But her most immediate problem is her abusive ex-husband Raymond Blackstone, who also happens to be a corrupt cop with connections. Chance falls for Jaclyn and becomes obsessed with helping her but he quickly realizes that he's in over his head. Help eventually comes in the form of a hulking man called D. While clearly a bit unhinged, asocial and disturbed, D is also highly skilled, calculated, smart and efficient and possesses huge knowledge of tactics, weaponry and hand-to-hand combat.

{"Title": "Coupling", "Year": "2000–2004", "Rated": "TV-14", "Released": "01 Sep 2001", "Runtime": "30 min", "Genre": "Comedy, Romance", "Director": "N/A", "Writer": "N/A", "Actors": "Jack Davenport, Gina Bellman, Sarah Alexander", "Plot": "On average, men and women think about sex every six seconds. Shorten that to every second, and you've got Coupling. It's more than just a one night stand! When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps... Susan Walker is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick Maitland, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, London's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally Harper is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. Meanwhile, Steve Taylor, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane Christie, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff Murdoch is Steve's \"porn buddy\" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling. Coupling has been honoured with the prestigious Silver Rose of Montreux, Best TV Comedy Award, and is recent winner at the 2003 British Comedy Awards. With a new guy on the scene, a baby on the way, commitment in the air, and love on the horizon, the dynamics of the six friends are definitely changing. At the end of last season Susan and Steve discovered they were pregnant (well, mostly Susan), confirmed bachelor Patrick and Sally finally admitted their true feelings for each other, and poor Jane was left on her own, once again. But it's not all doom and gloom for Jane. As the new season opens, things are looking up. There's this guy called Oliver, who has his eye on her. Is it possible that lifetime loser in love Oliver might just get somewhere with lifetime loser in love Jane? Trouble is, his apartment is a little \"un-edited\" and his living room has lost the battle with magazine nudity... Susan and Steve are now well and truly an item. So why is he dreaming about being executed by a fetus with an axe? Meanwhile Sally and Patrick are settling into their new relationship. But since the dawn of time, men and women have been falling in love - and men have been trying to get home straight afterwards. Can fallen playboy Patrick ever find his way back from the enchanted glade of his one true love and get a decent night's sleep?", "Language": "English", "Country": "United Kingdom", "Awards": "2 wins & 2 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2EzMTA4MjgtOTBiYS00NGI2LWJhYTQtYWUzZDI2YjI2NTJlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.5/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.5", "imdbVotes": "48,921", "imdbID": "tt0237123", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "4", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.3702965388074517, "Tense-Calm": -0.32588858157396317}, "Response": "True"},

{"Title": "Deal or No Deal", "Year": "2005–2019", "Rated": "TV-PG", "Released": "19 Dec 2005", "Runtime": "120 min", "Genre": "Family, Game-Show", "Director": "N/A", "Writer": "N/A", "Actors": "Howie Mandel, Patricia Kara, Megan Abrigo", "Plot": "The United States' version of \"Deal or No Deal\" was based on the Netherlands game show that had premiered in 2002. The main objective of the game was identical: Select a case containing a mystery cash amount, then - after being asked to narrow the field of cases by a certain number at various intervals - decide whether to take a cash buyout offered by an unseen \"banker\" (\"Deal\") or reject the offer and continue eliminating cases (\"No Deal\"), knowing he/she could win the grand prize of $1 million ... or far less. Each new game begins with 26 cases, each randomly distributed and held by a sexy model. The contestant chooses one case, which is placed at his/her contestant's podium. The cash amount inside could be as little as 1 cent ($.01) or as much as $1 million. The player then is asked to eliminate six of the remaining cases, calling out the corresponding numbers one at a time. After each number is called, that case is opened, revealing one of the 26 cash prizes; that prize is then eliminated from play. After the six cases are opened, host Mandell receives a call from The Banker, who makes an offer to buy back the player's case. The offer is based on the cash amounts still in play; although this initial offer is fairly small, it is usually higher if more of the small amounts - usually, those under $10,000 - were taken out of play. If the player chooses to accept the offer (\"Deal\"), he/she presses a button at his/her podium to confirm the decision. At that point, his/her game ends, the amount inside the case, and the cases remaining in play are revealed. However, should the contestant refuse The Banker's offer (\"No Deal,\" which always happened at least on the early deals), he/she is then directed to eliminate five cases from play, after which another deal is offered, which - depending on what prizes are eliminated during this round - may be higher or lower than the previous offer. Subsequent rounds have the contestant eliminating four, three and two cases from the remaining field, with Banker deals after each elimination round; thereafter, the contestant withdraws one case each time. During these latter rounds, the contestant often received advice from a group of supporters (his/her family, friends and others) on whether to accept or decline the offer. This process continues until two cases remain - the player's and the one yet to be eliminated - and one final deal is made. Should the contestant refuse the final offer, one of two things may happen. If the game's outcome is rather anti-climatic (i.e., only very small amounts remain), the contestant's case is opened and he/she wins the cash amount inside. However, if at least one of the large amounts remains in play, he/she is offered a chance to swap cases and then given another final deal; after the player's decision, the player's case is opened and he/she wins accordingly. \"Deal or No Deal\" premiered on NBC in December 2005 with a week's worth of shows to promising ratings; a second set of five episodes in Februrary and March 2006 did just as well, earning a twice-weekly spot on the NBC prime-time schedule. During each game, home viewers are invited to play a \"Lucky Case\" game, in which they enter - via their cellular telephone keypad - which of six cases they believe contains the $10,000 grand prize. Those who select the right case are entered into a random drawing, with four winners selected (one from each time zone) to win the $10,000 prize.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy. 2 wins & 9 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGZjMjIxNzEtOTAxZi00MzIyLWFmY2QtZTYwZWRiOTY2ZGQzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "5.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "5.0", "imdbVotes": "4,398", "imdbID": "tt0493378", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "5", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.5382790006697178, "Tense-Calm": -0.15711091458797455}, "Response": "True"},

Filled with dreams of being a cool teenager, Chris moves with his family from the projects to the \"Bed-Stuy: Do or Die\" neighborhood. As the family's emergency adult while his parents are working, he's responsible for taking care of his younger brother Drew (Tequan Richmond), who's taller and more confident than Chris, and sister Tonya (Imani Hakim), who gets all the parents' attention. Chris' rough, cost-conscious father Julius (Terry Crews) works numerous jobs to properly support his family. Sassy mom Rochelle (Tichina Arnold) runs the household on a tight budget, is very strict, and works part-time in a small real estate office. With his mom determined to see him in a good school, though Drew and Tonya go to the same school in their old neighborhood, Chris reluctantly faces multiple bus transfers every day to attend Corleone Junior High in the fiercely Italian neighborhood, South Shore. Despite being an immediate target for bullies, Chris' innate charm and sharp wit enable him to make new friends, like Greg (Vincent Martella), another smart, nice kid... who can't fight, by the way. As Chris Rock pointedly looks back, his younger self is set to find what his family already knows: Chris' sharp, scrappy character is going to take him places.

He has just returned from military service and is about to marry the girl of his dreams, the stunning Eysan. His two best friends, Cengiz and Ali are like brothers to him, and he trusts them with all his heart. Everything seems perfect, as his whole life lies in front of him. The drama starts when the police storm into Omer's bedroom when he is still sleeping. He gets arrested for a murder and robbery at the casino the night before. Omer gets imprisoned for the crime - his life is shattered, friends and fiancé disappear. Instead, one single question is on his mind for the next ten years: Why? It is obvious that Omer has been set up, but could such a terrible crime really have been planned by his two best friends and fiancé Eysan? Omer gets eventually declared dead in prison, but the death is a cover up for the revenge to come. After plastic surgery Omer returns as Ezel, with only one mission in life - to find an explanation, and to take everything away from those who once destroyed his life. But first, he has to kill the constant, incorrigible, and endless love he still carries for the girl of his dreams, Eysan. One by one, the pieces fall in place in a very thrilling story. Omer's two best friends Ali and Cengiz were convinced to rob the casino by the mafioso Serdar Tezcan , who also happens to be Omer's girlfriend Eysan's father. Serdar created the whole plan. He needed four people for a successful robbery. The first, Cengiz would be the mole who was working in the casino and who would therefore gain access. The second, Ali would be the ruthless killer who has no problem committing murder if needed. The third, Eysan would be the skilled con-woman who would manipulate the characters. Finally, Omer would be blamed for the robbery by way of implanting false evidence, and therefore misleading the police and causing them to cease all other investigations. Eysan would later testify in court in order to re-establish the evidence and accusations, thus cementing her betrayal. The plan worked successfully and while all 4 got away with millions of dollars' worth of money, Omer went to jail the day after he proposed to Eysan. In 2006, Omer, who had a full plastic surgery, and changed his name to Ezel Bayraktar (\"eternity\" in Turkish), returns to get his revenge, unknown to his previous friends, Eysan and Cengiz (who are now married with a son), and Ali (who is head of security at Cengiz's hotel) The once simple boy becomes a man exceptionally skilled at gambling, reading people, fighting, and has considerably high class in society.

These creatures existed as stone during the day, but become flesh and blood at night. One Scottish clan made an alliance with humans to help protect a castle by night if the humans would protect their stone forms by day. The uneasy alliance was shattered when human prejudice provoked a betrayal that allowed the castle to be sacked and most of the resident clan destroyed, leaving only six adult survivors and a rookery of unhatched eggs. A further misunderstanding during the clan's retaliation on the invaders and rescue of their hostages left the clan frozen in stone by a magic spell that would only be broken when the \"castle rises above the clouds.\" For a thousand years, the castle laid abandoned and the clan condemned by this curse. In 1994, a wealthy multibillionare named David Xanatos (Jonathan Frakes) bought the castle and transported the whole structure to Manhattan, where he placed it on top of the Eyrie building which he owned. It is high enough to be above the clouds, thus the conditions of the spell were met and the Gargoyles were revived. Now, this clan must adjust to this new age and gain friends, like Detective Elisa Maza (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), who reveals that Xanatos revived them to exploit them for his unscrupulous ends. This is coupled by the fact that another Gargoyle comrade, Demona (Marina Sirtis), is alive from their age, and is now an insane renegade bent on the extermination of humanity. Rebelling against them, the clan abandon the castle and pledge to protect New York City like they protected the castle in the past.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States, Japan, Canada, Philippines, Hong Kong, China", "Awards": "1 win & 12 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0ZjcxZjMtODU0NC00MWIyLTk5NWMtZDhhODlmMjI4M2Y1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.0/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.0", "imdbVotes": "19,092", "imdbID": "tt0108783", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "3", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.04064171016216278, "Tense-Calm": -0.43733691424131393}, "Response": "True"},

Kagome accidentally awakens the dog-demon Inuyasha, and frees him after the jewel has been ripped from her body. Now Inuyasha wants the jewel back, but Kagome can't let him have it. He is forced (by Kaede's magic) to wear a necklace that allows Kagome to control him with one word, \"Sit!\", which sends him face-first into the ground. Kagome accidentally shatters the jewel, and now she and Inuyasha have to work together to find all the pieces before they fall into the wrong hands. Only Kagome can \"sense\" where the shards are, and only Inuyasha is powerful enough to get them from the demons or people who have them.

It, too, was a huge success, and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Art World, Cooking, 20th Century Republicans, \"Friends (1994)\", Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., \"College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100\"), to which host Trebek reads the answer (\"Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts\"). Contestants had to respond in question form (\"What is Hanes?\") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was \"always in jeopardy\") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a \"Daily Double\" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into \"Double Jeopardy!\" Gameplay was the same in \"Double Jeopardy!\" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two \"Daily Double\" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the \"Double Jeopardy!\" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play \"Final Jeopardy!\"; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a \"Clue Crew\" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going \"on location\"), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of \"celebrity guests\" reading certain answers.

Host Fred Rogers (known to millions as simply Mister Rogers) used his gentle charm to communicate with his audience of children. Topics centered on nearly every inconceivable matter of concern to children, ranging from everyday fears related to going to sleep, getting immunizations, and disappointment about not getting one's way, to losing a loved one to death and physical handicaps. Rogers used simple songs and, on nearly every show, segments from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to make his point. A scale-model trolley was often (but not always) used to segue into the Make-Believe segments, said neighborhood being inhabited by puppet characters including King Friday XIII, Lady Elaine Fairchilde and Daniel Stripèd Tiger. Frequent visitors as well as Rogers' own frequent visits to various places in the neighborhood rounded out each show. The program was taped at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh; first-run shows were produced from 1968 to 1975, at which time production was suspended until 1979. New programs were taped through 2001 for broadcast alongside the original 460 episodes, the most notable coming in 1991 with Rogers's shows focusing on calming children's fears during the Persian Gulf War.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Nominated for 3 Primetime Emmys. 8 wins & 66 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ3ZWFkZDMtNjlmNC00NWNmLWJlYzctMDlkZDdiNDBiZTgxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.7", "imdbVotes": "9,771", "imdbID": "tt0062588", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "31", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.507674453780055, "Tense-Calm": 0.08778782188892365}, "Response": "True"},

Like its earlier novel and big-screen brethren, \"Mr. Belvedere\" featured British butler Lynn Belvedere, who takes a job as a live-in nanny for a typical American family and records their everyday experiences in his diary for future use in writing a novel. In the 1985 small-screen version, the Owens family served as that \"typical American family\" and the source of fodder for Belvedere, who had previously worked as a gentry for Winston Churchill and had connections to British royalty. Family patriarch George (played by sportscaster Bob Uecker) was, in an example of art imitating life, a sportswriter; the matriarch was Marsha, a law student. The couple, who had settled in suburban Pittsburgh, had three children: awkward teenager Kevin; precocious, easily-embarrassed Heather; and mischievous prankster Wesley. George was initially uncomfortable hiring the worldly Belvedere but eventually came to appreciate the Englishman's friendship (as well as his expert culinary skills). Unlike his older siblings, Wesley never seemed to get along with Belvedere, but even he came to appreciate the British native's regularly-dispensed advice. Each episode ended with Belvedere writing in his journal, giving the show's moral while putting everything into perspective. In later years, Marsha graduated from law school and got her first job, and Kevin and Heather graduated from high school and entered college. The 1985 small-screen adaptation of \"Mr. Belvedere\" marked the end of a long succession of unsuccessful attempts to bring Davenport's novel to television; the three earlier pilots were made in the 1950s (soon after the final big-screen movie) and 1960s.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Won 1 Primetime Emmy. 2 wins & 12 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjIxYWY0ZmMtMTgzMS00ZGU1LTg5OGYtNDdhNGY0NmEzMGYxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "6.6/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "6.6", "imdbVotes": "5,172", "imdbID": "tt0088576", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "6", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.7844135668128729, "Tense-Calm": -0.24961712956428528}, "Response": "True"},

They hire Erica, a girl from Ethan's high school who is a huge fan of \"Dusk\", as a babysitter. However, Erica comes across her best friend Sarah, and Jesse, Sarah's vampire ex-boyfriend, on the night she is to babysit, and decides to attend a party that Jesse is throwing instead. During a fight between Sarah and Jesse, Sarah ends up at Ethan's house and tells Ethan's parents that she was asked to babysit instead. Ethan has a vision when touching Sarah, and notices she has no reflection in the mirror, leaving him suspicious of her. He confides this in his dorky best friend, Benny. Sarah leaves to get Erica back from the party, knowing the party is full of bloodthirsty vampires. Curious, the boys have Benny's grandmother watch over Jane while they follow Sarah. They see her feed on a rat and realize she is a vampire. Sarah quickly explains that she is only a fledgling, a vampire who has not drunk human blood. The three of them return home, where they are attacked by a vampire sent by Jesse. The vampire is subdued by Sarah and they head to the vampire party to save Erica and and their dimwitted friend, Rory. However, Erica has been bitten by Gord and later bites Rory. Ethan, Benny, and Sarah then battle the vampires and escape. The next day, Rory, now a full vampire after drinking human blood, informs Ethan and Benny that Jesse's gang are going to church so Ethan, Benny and Sarah follow them. Ethan has a vision in which he sees a gravestone, whose dates unscramble to the number 219, and a mysterious box, which is then uncovered by the vampires. The box is called the Cubile Animus or \"Nest of Souls.\" Ethan and Sarah figure out Jesse's full plan from an old book, learning that in the original settlement of the town, there was a priest named Reverend Horace Black that led an evil vampire cult. The townspeople burned the cult members, leading to all \"219\" of their deaths during a lunar eclipse. In another vision, Ethan sees that Jesse is Horace Black, and plans to use the box to trap the souls of teens going to see a movie premiere to resurrect the souls of his ancient cult during the lunar eclipse occurring on that same night. Benny's grandmother, who reveals that she is an Earth Priestess, gives Ethan, Benny and Sarah enchanted daggers and a spellbook to defeat the vampires. She explains that Ethan sees visions because he is a Seer, which enables him to see visions through touch, and that Benny is a spellmaster, allowing him to cast spells. At the theater, the vampires begin to steal the souls of the teens, but are thwarted by Ethan, Benny and Sarah. Jesse escapes and Ethan and Benny follow in pursuit. In another vision, Ethan sees the tree he saw inside the old book, realizing it's the tree in his backyard, where they find Jesse. As the eclipse begins, Jesse attempts to hold Ethan and Benny down and resurrect the souls he already obtained from the Cubile Animus, but Sarah intervenes. When the box lands in Ethan's hands, he releases the vengeful souls that were captured, and they destroy Jesse. The next day, Ethan, Benny and Sarah head to school, meeting Erica and Rory, who have decided to live peacefully as vampires.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Canada", "Awards": "3 wins & 3 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVlMmY3ZDctNDA0ZC00ZWIzLWE4OGItYjY5NzZiYjQzMTBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "5,412", "imdbID": "tt1727434", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "2", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.3300102986395359, "Tense-Calm": -0.15700945258140564}, "Response": "True"},

The five are: Chuck Taggart - a charismatic authoritative and stoic mission commander and former ace pilot, Kurt Mendel - a likable pompous horny quip-prone British science author and NASA's special celebrity guest on the flight who actually does know a lot about science and can be brave and cunning despite claiming otherwise, Neil Taggart - Chuck's young adult son and genuine computer expert, Sarah Forbes - a popular news anchor and TV reporter who's there to make an exclusive piece about the mission, and Angela Perry - Chuck's experienced co-pilot who's father is a powerful senator. Everything is going fine until the Earth is suddenly caught on fire and then implodes for no apparent reason. This horrifying mysterious event damages the crew's shuttle, which leads to the death of the technician and also leaves Angela badly hurt and unconscious. Just before their oxygen runs out, the crew is saved by a friendly alien AI construct, who calls himself the Seeker and who's been investigating similar planetary destructions for some time now. Since each destroyed planet was home to a developing civilization like human on Earth, the Seeker believes that someone or something is intentionally causing these catastrophes to happen with the goal of eradicating sentient life entirely. He asks the crew for help and they agree. The Seeker sends their consciousnesses through time and they all wake up on Earth five years in the past. This gives them the chance to find out who or what caused the destruction of Earth and stop it. However, the fact that they know the future and that they act on this knowledge causes slight changes and some things happen differently, which sometimes proves to be beneficial but at other times leads to tragedy. They also have new problems in their personal lives. Chuck can't convince his wife that he's seen the future, which jeopardizes their marriage. Also, his other son Marc tries to impress him by trying to become an astronaut despite the fact that he hates the job. Kurt tries to use his knowledge of the future for his personal benefit but it backfires. Neil is now a teenager again and has to go back to high school. Also, his girlfriend is now underage as well which makes things a bit awkward for him. Sarah's little son has died from cancer in the original timeline, so she does all she can to prevent this from happening this time. However, her obsession causes her husband at the time to think that she's insane and potentially dangerous for the boy. On the other hand, Sarah has to deal with the fact that her future husband is now just one of her coworkers, who's still with his future ex. Angela's ability to perform her duty is questioned after an accident caused by the time travel and there's danger that she won't be on the Odyssey mission in five years if she fails her psych test. Also, her father may or may not be somehow involved with what happens to Earth. The crew's favorite hangout place is a nice quiet local diner where they can consult one another and plan their next moves or simply unwind. They soon finds evidence of a major conspiracy but they'll have to dig much deeper to determine who's behind it, what it's goals are and whether or not it actually has anything to do with the future destruction of Earth. Their only clew is the word Leviathan that showed up on their shuttle's monitor just before Earth's destruction and suspects include human conspirators within NASA and the US government, powerful mysterious AI beings called Sentients and possibly even aliens.

{"Title": "Popular", "Year": "1999–2001", "Rated": "TV-14", "Released": "29 Sep 1999", "Runtime": "1 min", "Genre": "Comedy, Drama, Romance", "Director": "N/A", "Writer": "Gina Matthews, Ryan Murphy", "Actors": "Leslie Bibb, Carly Pope, Tamara Mello", "Plot": "The two girls who are seen in their fictional Jacqueline Kennedy High School as the leaders of two main opposing cliques, the popular one and the not so popular one, clash heads when their single parents meet, fall in love and decide to get hitched. However, both the girls and their two cliques slowly grow together and become an unlikely group of friends with both typical and not so typical high school and young adult problems. Brooke McQueen is the captain of Glamazons, the school's cheerleading squad. She's considered smart, beautiful and perfect. Privately, she's been dealing with self-image and body image issues ever since her estranged mother left her and her father. She also tries to fight the popular image people have of her. She wants to be good and does good and often helps people instead of thinking only about herself but she also has a suppressed selfish side. Sam McPherson aims to have the opposite image of Brooke's. She's attracted to journalism and wants to be the voice of nonconformists. Despite this, she has several flaws like being too judgmental, underestimating people or ignoring the fact that she sometimes acts hypocritically, especially when it comes to love. Her anger partially stems from the trauma of losing her father to leukemia. Lily Esposito is the schools top environmentalist, animal and human rights activist and an all-around liberal On the other hand, she has a fear of sex and sexuality and this creates problems in her relationships with men. She's Sam's friend and so is Harrison John, the ultimate friend-zoned guyfriend, who's been friends with both Brooke and Sam for a long time and has a crush on Brooke ever since childhood but also feels certain attraction to Sam. These three friends make the ultimate love triangle. Carmen Ferrara is a slightly overweight girl, who tries to deal with her body issues by trying to accept and enjoy who she is. Despite being friends with Sam's group, her dream is to become one of the Glamazons and be friends with the popular girls as well and she goes for it. Josh Ford is the school's hot popular quarterback, who at first seems like a walking jock stereotype but actually has a lot of depth and is for the most part a nice guy. He dates Brooke at first and they become the school's ultimate power couple but he eventually decides to quit trying to be what other people want him to be and become his own man. Nicole Julian is the second in command of Glamazons but always wants more power and influence. She's assertive, smart, cynical, egotistical, Machiavellian, combative and attractive and she knows it. She sees herself as the Queen B of the school and wants everyone to know it and respect it. She does not play fair and wants to see all her real and perceived enemies destroyed. The only people she respects are Gwyneth Paltrow and for the most part Brooke. However, she sometimes shows her suppressed empathic side and in those moments she becomes a true friend. Michael 'Sugar Daddy' Bernardino is Josh's towering best friend. He's cheerful, fun, acts like a rapper, takes the simple approach to life but also suffers from morbid obesity. He doesn't let this bother him though and uses his size to his advantage when playing football with Josh for the school's team. Mary Cherry is Nicole's larger than life, super rich, both genuinely quirky and amusingly psychotic, best friend and a Glamazon, although Nicole usually treats her like her sidekick. Jane McPherson is Sam's loving mom. Mike McQueen is Brooke's loving dad. The two meet and fall in love which eventually leads to marriage. Brooke and Sam can't accept this and even do their best to try to break them up but the girls eventually see the upside of becoming stepsisters, which doesn't stop them from occasionally stabbing each other in the back. Bobbi Glass is the gang's conservative, androgynous, charismatic, ingenious, commanding, tyrannical female biology, science and chemistry teacher and a true frienemy who always comes up with creative ways to put her students down but she also has a somewhat of an empathic side to her. She has several twin brothers and sisters. April Tuna is the school's scary unhinged psychotic nerdy ginger with a potent sex drive, but boys avoid her nonetheless. She leads the actual unpopular kids from the fringes of high school society and has her eye on Harrison. Emory Dick is Harrison's self-confident geeky friend who doesn't even try to fit in and likes it that way. He's always ready to help his friends and often comes up with silly creative plans that sometime actually make things worse. Poppita Fresh is the African American Glamazon and fits in perfectly with Nicole and Mary Cherry. George Austin is a smart, nice, hot, and caring African American jock, who falls for Sam and she reciprocates. Freddy Gong is the school's uneasy Asian American student, who has a strange masochistic rapport with Nicole. Principal Cecilia Hall is the school's caring blind principal who always tries to be just and help the students as well as protect the school's interests. Vice-Principal Calvin Krupps arrives later to help the school deal with conflicts between students. He's a very smart man, who doesn't mind playing games or confronting students openly if he believes that some good will come of it. Principal Hall eventually disappears from the show and he becomes the schools acting principal and he and Ms. Glass become buds. Godfrey is Ms. Glass' very strange on and off boyfriend who eventually becomes a priest. Cherry Cherry is Mary Cherry's super rich super charismatic no-nonsense mother and businesswoman who talks tough and acts accordingly. Her dream is to marry the real life actor Erik Estrada and when she wants something, she means business. The show's plots, arcs and subplots range from creative quirky over the top parodies to enhanced reality situations and typical high school drama. Due to unforeseen cancellation, the show ends on a huge cliffhanger.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "5 wins & 9 nominations", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThkZWQxOTUtZDBmZC00ZTllLWFmMDgtMjhhM2E4NGZkZmMwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.4/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "6,976", "imdbID": "tt0202748", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "2", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.0879700630903244, "Tense-Calm": -0.2984408736228943}, "Response": "True"},
