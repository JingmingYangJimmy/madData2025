The town's long history of strange disappearances and ghost and monster sightings form the basis for its thriving tourist industry, and as such, the gang's parents and some people (mostly Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone) are not happy that their children are debunking all the supernatural goings-on that bring in so much revenue as the overwrought schemes of charlatans and criminals. In addition to the traditional cases they always solve, the team finds itself being nudged into the uncovering of a dark secret that is hidden in the past of Crystal Cove, covered up by parties unknown. The new Mystery Incorporated is following cryptic hints from a faceless mystery-man known only as \"Mr. E\".

As they investigate further the mystery about the curse of Crystal Cove, they discover that a creature known as \"The Freak of Crystal Cove\" threatens and stalks anyone who comes near the haunted treasure. They uncover the Freak's true identity to be Mayor Fred Jones Sr. who reveals that Fred's true parents are Brad and Judy from the original Mystery, Inc. In the aftermath, Fred goes off to find his real parents and breaks his engagement with Daphne, declaring that \"Mystery, Inc. is dead\".

He becomes a favorite of the crowd, leading Senator Albinius to commute his death sentence to a life of slavery.

The tasks will test their intelligence, chutzpah and street-smarts. They will face the challenges of living in close quarters and must compete sometimes humorous but always difficult job assignments and will be forced to think outside the box in order to outshine each other to get to the top. Upon their arrival to New York City (some for the very first time), the 16 candidates will be rushed over to Trump Tower to meet with Donald Trump, the centerpiece and driving force of this series. After splitting the group into two teams of 8, Trump then issues the first task. Teams will be given time constraints for each task and they will be observed by either Trump himself or members of his staff at every moment along the way. At the conclusion of each task, the winning team will be granted a lavish reward but the losing team must report immediately to Trump's boardroom where one of them will be fired. Tasks each week will incorporate various aspects of business: sales, marketing, promotions, charities, real estate deals, finance, advertising pitches and facilities management. Most of them will be assignments that executives face in their daily lives. The big twist is that our teams are thrown out to the wolves of the New York business world with only a few days to complete incredibly difficult tasks, many of which have hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake.

Helping Johnny make a fresh start are his physical trainer Bruce, who also becomes a close friend; his mother's priest, Gene Purdy, who sets up a trust fund for Johnny, but may not be looking out for Johnny's best interests; and Sarah, who must find a way to make Johnny a part of her life again without risking her relationship with her husband and son.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Canada, United States", "Awards": "3 wins & 16 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWEzY2FiODYtZDA1Ny00NTNkLTg1M2QtZjU1ZDY0NzJmNTVlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "10,249", "imdbID": "tt0281432", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "6", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.3566528931260109, "Tense-Calm": -0.564387209713459}, "Response": "True"},

His family included his wife Louise, a level-headed and open-minded woman who often had to scold George when his mouth got him into trouble; and their son Lionel, an engineering major at a local college. George especially disliked Tom and Helen Willis, an interracial couple (he was white, she was Black) whose daughter Jenny was dating and later married Lionel; Florence, his sharp-tongued maid; and Harry Bentley, the esoteric Englishman who lived next door. George often flaunted his wealth and displayed rude, arrogant, bigoted behavior; however, he often found that money didn't open every door or win him favor with everyone. In later years, George and Louise became grandparents when Lionel and Jenny welcomed their adorable little daughter Jessica; and Lionel and Jenny found work, he as an electrical engineer, she as a fashion designer; but Lionel and Jenny's marriage crumbled. Meanwhile, as Jefferson Cleaners continued to expand, George continually had to deal with competing dry-cleaning franchises who sought to put him out of business.

After a traumatic time serving as a mercenary at the Silesian front, Jan deserts from the Austrian army. Destitute and exhausted, he returns home, to the Flemish region of Aalst. To his surprise, everything has changed beyond recognition. His village has been transformed into a French army encampment. His family and friends have been outlawed and banished to Kluisbossen forest. Jan joins the ramshackle gang of robbers led by his half-brother Tincke. But in a country suffering under the yoke of poverty and exploitation, there's hardly anything left worth taking. Moved by these harsh living conditions, Jan manages to convince Tincke to see the bigger picture. Instead of stealing from each other, they should rob those who actually have money: the rich and the collaborators consorting with the French occupiers. John's ideas start to resonate and when a stagecoach is raided successfully, the ragtag bunch of scallywags develops into a real gang. The decision to share their booty with the poorest of the poor makes them popular, and their motto, \"Voor gene chanterik peu\"(not afraid of anyone), spreads across the land like wildfire. When the authorities catch wind of this, the ambitious city guard Baru declares war on Jan and his gang. Thanks to his dedicated police work, Baru manages to infiltrate the gang and capture John. During his captivity, John's popularity only increases. The gang is out for revenge and will do anything to liberate Jan: it's the beginning of a war that leads to outright revolution. Jan de Lichte becomes a mythical folk hero. Even after his public execution some people believe John to be still alive.

These stories may demonstrate the emotional ties that exist not only because of being family, but also because of four of them having the same birthday and some of them having always been together, meaning since conception.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "Won 4 Primetime Emmys. 67 wins & 296 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk4YzY2ZjUtNTQ2YS00MWQ5LTgzZjctZTRlMmZlMzNjNDc3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.7/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.7", "imdbVotes": "164,966", "imdbID": "tt5555260", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "6", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": -0.0841996967792511, "Tense-Calm": -0.4824650138616562}, "Response": "True"},

But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him. Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside.", "Language": "English", "Country": "Australia", "Awards": "19 wins & 75 nominations total", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIxOGFkODctMmIxNS00YzQwLTgxZjMtMzgyYTk5YWYxYTU5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.6/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.6", "imdbVotes": "25,961", "imdbID": "tt2433738", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "9", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": -0.17923547327518463, "Tense-Calm": -0.9808279615826905}, "Response": "True"},

There are the just-married Nic and Angelo, the seemingly happily married Dave and Deena and the newly-engaged Marjorie and Adam. But -- what about Brian? Of this close-knit group of friends, everyone else has paired off, while Brian has emerged as the last bachelor standing. At 34, regardless of his run of bad luck in matters of the heart, Brian still holds out hope that one day he'll open the door and be blinded by love. However questions about his fate have been popping up more frequently in his head. The most pressing question is - and it's one that only he can answer -- could all of his problems stem from the fact that he is harboring a crush on the picture-perfect Marjorie, his best friend's girl? Adam, Brian's best friend since childhood, was going to break up with Marjorie but found himself proposing to her instead. He's a lawyer and Marjorie is a pediatric surgeon. Their busy lifestyles leave them little time to plan their upcoming wedding and, oddly enough, that seems to have given them more time to re-evaluate whether they're indeed doing the right thing. Brian's fortysomething sister, Nic, and her boy-toy husband, Angelo, are trying hard to start a family, but something's not right. Nic's high-stress work as a record executive and Angelo's fledgling acting career have created some anxiety in the new marriage. Now they're torn between conceiving a child the old-fashioned way or using modern medicine to speed up the process. Dave, who runs a video game business with Brian called Zap Monkey, is married to stay-at-home mom Deena. They've been together for 13 years, have three little girls and a lackluster sex life. This prompts the frustrated and unconventional Deena to suggest to the more content Dave that they consider having an open marriage. Like all married people and their single friends, they can't wait for Brian to join their \"club,\" though they're not exactly sure why.", "Language": "English", "Country": "United States", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwOWQ5NGYtNDkxYi00ZjhiLWI4Y2MtOTlmODMwZDNlMTRkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "3,782", "imdbID": "tt0460693", "Type": "series", "totalSeasons": "2", "AggregatedEmotion": {"Sad-Happy": 0.2895359843969345, "Tense-Calm": -0.4224529191851616}, "Response": "True"},
